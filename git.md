Git is a version control system for computer files, it was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the linux kernel.

His design criteria specified four things: 

* Patching should take no more than three seconds
* Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision
* Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow
* Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious

Its current maintainer, since 2005 is Junio Hamano.

Linus Torvalds work on the Linux Kernel had shifted from writing code to being the top level maintainer of the kernel meaning
that most of his work consists of merging code from many different sources. This means merging has to be fast and painless,
also a distributed workflow was important for linux. By 2005 the linux kernel had become a big open-source project and it's
distributed organisational structure reflects that.
